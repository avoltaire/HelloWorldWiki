# HelloWorldWiki

Welcome to the official repository for [HelloWorldWiki.com](https://helloworldwiki.com) – a community-curated archive of over 300 programming languages, tools, and frameworks. Each entry includes runnable “Hello World” examples, execution instructions, key concepts, and trivia.

This project is built for students, teachers, developers, and lifelong learners who want to explore the full spectrum of programming languages. Every entry goes beyond syntax—covering the language’s history, how to run it, its core features, and fun facts—making it a rich resource for both education and exploration.
