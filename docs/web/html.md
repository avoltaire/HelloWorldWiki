### Category

### Description  
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating and structuring content on the web. It defines the layout and meaning of text, images, and interactive elements in a browser.

### History  
HTML was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and formed the foundation of the early World Wide Web. It has evolved over several major revisions, with HTML5 (2014) introducing modern APIs for video, canvas, and more.
